# StayHydrated

## What's This?

StayHydrated is your new best buddy who won’t let you dry up! This Python script gives you a nudge to chug some H2O at regular intervals. Stay hydrated, my friend! I made this script only for you!

JUST KIDDING... I FORGOT TO DRINK WATER FOR LAST 6 HOURS WORKING ON SOME STUPID OPENCV PROJECT. 😭😭😭
So I decided to spend 8 minutes 37 seconds on another python script and this is the result.

## Features

- Set it and forget it: Just tell it how often you want to be reminded.
- Desktop notifications because sticky notes are so 2001.
- Optional: Add a snazzy icon to make it fancy!(I didn't though... U code it yourself lol.)

## What You Need

- Python 3.x (if you don’t have it, are you even a programmer?)
- `plyer` library for basic notifications (cross-platform love😏❤️)
- `win10toast` library for Windows users who want the deluxe experience(Heh lol jk... Just gave u the clue code it yourself!)

## Installation (aka Making It Work)

1. Clone the cool repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thisizaro/StayHydrated.git
   ```
